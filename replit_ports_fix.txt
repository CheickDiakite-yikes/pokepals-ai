IMPORTANT: Port Configuration Fix for Deployment

The .replit file needs to be manually updated to reorder ports.
Current configuration has port 3001 first, but production needs port 5000 first.

Required change in .replit file:
1. Move the port 5000 configuration to be FIRST in the [[ports]] section
2. Keep port 3001 configuration second (for development)

This is because Autoscale Deployments expect the application to listen on 
the FIRST localPort configured, and your production server uses port 5000.
